What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- creates a new git repository
- makes all files in that dir as untracked files.
- create my own repository to make use of version control on my files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- git diff tells diff between working dir and staging area
- git diff --staged gives diff between staging area and latest commit.
- git add <file name>  - adds file to the staging area
-git commit - commits changes to the repository


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- doing experimental changes to code
- adding new feature to your project but still keeping a working copy of the project
