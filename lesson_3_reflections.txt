When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 - If I want to share my work with others
 - If multiple people are working on a project
 - If i want to work on a project from multiple machine
 - It also acts as a backup on cloud, in case of any loss or damage to the local copies.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
 - When I working on a feature, and have not completed it , and some one else adds there code to the branch , an automatic pull would merge all the changes which could not just break my code, but also cause a lot of confusion and difficulty and resolving merges and fixing every thing.
 
 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 
  - forks - makes a copy of a repository from one git hub account to another.
  - clones - copies a repository from git hub to a local machine
  - branches - creates a new branch in the exiting repository
  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  - When pushing to the github, in case of multiple collaboraters/work machines, the local git can identify that there might be a merge commit required and it also helps in finding merge conflicts.
