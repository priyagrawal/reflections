When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 - If I want to share my work with others
 - If multiple people are working on a project
 - If i want to work on a project from multiple machine
 - It also acts as a backup on cloud, in case of any loss or damage to the local copies.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
 - When I working on a feature, and have not completed it , and some one else adds there code to the branch , an automatic pull would merge all the changes which could not just break my code, but also cause a lot of confusion and difficulty and resolving merges and fixing every thing.
